 SoftUni project
So first I made the nav bar 
Now I am working on the registration page where the design is almost done, but I have not started the backend yet. After the design, I will immediately start with the backend.
I started with the backend a week ago. I encountered some problems but I dealt with them.
Now I am working on the main page design which is actually not easy if u do not have an idea of how u want to look and the skills to build something. I am
watching from YouTube most of the time for the design with little corrections. This is for now.
